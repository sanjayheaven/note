# Virtual DOM

## What is Virtual DOM?

VDOM is a javaScrip object to describe real DOM.

## Difference between Virtual DOM & Real DOM?

Real DOM is very complicated and updating real DOM is comparatively slower then updating the VDOM

For example, when we update the DOM 10 times, we can make these 10 updates together in javascript,
but if we update by real dom, it must be done ony by one. What if there are more than 10 updates in DOM?  
Therefore, it is better to use Virtual DOM.
